## Description

https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread/page/80/This repository contains a solution for the DengAI competition hosted on 
DrivenData.org. The goal is to predict the incidence of dengue fever in various 
regions using historical weather data. This project leverages the DengAI 
competition dataset and aims to provide a robust and accurate prediction model.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of historical weather data for various regions, including 
temperature, rainfall, humidity, and more. The target variable is the number of 
dengue fever cases.

## Solution Overview

This solution implements a [briefly mention the core model(s) used, e.g.,  
rnadom forest to predict dengue fever incidence. 

Key components of the solution include:

* **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature engineering, and data 
scaling.
* **EDA**
* **Model Training:** Training the chosen model(s) on the historical data.
* **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the model's performance using appropriate metrics (MAE).
* **Prediction Generation:** Generating predictions for the test data.

## Dependencies

You can install the dependencies with:
pip install -r requirements.txt
